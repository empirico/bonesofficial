    <p>The Band saw the light in 2006, born from Daniele&rsquo;s urgency to play some pure rock without any frills. After some changes, the lineup is now composed of Daniele himself (guitar and vocals), Alberto (bass) and Luca (drums). The main influences of the band are hard rock, blues, Black Sabbath and southern atmospheres.</p>
    <p>After a few live shows around Milan, the band started receiving positive feedback from the rock community and the songs found a better shape.We Choose Who Will Stand, Sci-Fi Girl and Modern Times Bacchanalia are completed and so Bones &amp; Comfort head into the studio at the end of 2008.</p>
    <p>After a few months of hard work and entire nights spent mixing, &ldquo;&hellip;in Fat we trust&rdquo; is completed by May 2009. The EP contains 5 original songs, self-recorded in their rehearsal room and in a friend&rsquo;s studio. The result reflects the live attitude of the band and the tacks are filled with warm sounds, heavy riffs and catchy choruses which show what Bones &amp; Comfort are aiming for.</p>
